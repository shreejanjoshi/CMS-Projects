# CMS-Projects

In this project I'm trying to make CMS of my own. The main reason I'm doing this project is to grow my own knowledge, building something from streatch will help me in long run.

### So What Going On

What I first did is added template from wrapbootstrap for cms projects. I don't want to spend my time on buiding degine in HTML and CSS so I basily skip that.
After that I made database in phpmyadmin with name CMS and made table category inside CMS.
Also I will use API called MYSQLI.

- I connect with database in another way by using array. It was really great experiences.

For my blog post I created table posts in database. And for now I just insert data directly in database and just call that data. I also used while loop so if just insert new data in table post then it will create new blog or post in my website.
